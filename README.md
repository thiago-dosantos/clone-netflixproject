# Netflix Clone Project

This project aims to exercise my React skills by creating a clone of the Netflix streaming landing page. It utilizes Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) in conjunction with Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/). The project also integrates the TMDB movie database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/).
